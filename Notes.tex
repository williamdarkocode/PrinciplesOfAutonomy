\section{About this course}
\paragraph*{}
This course surveys a variety of reasoning, optimization and decision 
making methodologies for creating highly autonomous systems and decision 
support aids. The focus is on principles, algorithms, and their 
application, taken from the disciplines of artificial intelligence and 
operations research.

Reasoning paradigms include logic and deduction, heuristic and 
constraint-based search, model-based reasoning, planning and execution, 
and machine learning. Optimization paradigms include linear programming, 
integer programming, and dynamic programming. Decision-making paradigms 
include decision theoretic planning, and Markov decision processes.
